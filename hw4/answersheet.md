### c

Radius:

Surface temperature:

### d

The surface temperature increases very slightly with time, then starts to decrease when the star leaves main sequence. There is also a sudden dip right at the beginning of helium fusion.

As for the size, it increases gradually during main sequence, then grows rapidly when the star becomes a red giant. The size shrinks as the helium fusion begin, and finally expands again after the fusion ended.

### e

![pp chain luminosity](./p1-1_pp_chain_luminosity_vs_age.png)

### f

The p-p chain serves as the main source of energy until about 10<sup>10</sup> years into the life cycle. Then the CNO cycle takes places as hydrogen shell burning starts. Finally the triple-alpha reaction begins and generates comparable luminosity to the CNO cycle.

### g

During main sequence, the neutrino luminosity stays between 10<sup>-7</sup> and 10<sup>-6</sup> the luminosity from p-p chain.

### h

The result matches what was described in the lecture. Most of the luminosity comes from the CNO cycle.

### i

Most of the luminosity comes from fusion between $0.2\ R_\odot$ and $1.5\ R_\odot$.
